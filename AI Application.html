Artificial intelligence has been used successfully in a wide range of fields including expert systems, natural language processing, voice recognition, image recognition and analysis as well as medical diagnosis, stock trading, automated control, law, scientific discovery, video games, toys and Internet search engines.  Often, when technology is widely used, it is not seen as artificial intelligence, and is sometimes described as the impact of artificial intelligence.[136]  It is also possible to incorporate it into artificial life.

 Contests and prizes edit
 There are a number of competitions and awards to encourage research in the field of artificial intelligence.  The main areas promoted are: general machine intelligence, conversational behavior, data analysis, driverless cars (self-driving cars), and robot football and gaming.
