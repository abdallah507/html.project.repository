be divided into:

 Narrow AI edit
 It is artificial intelligence that specializes in one field, for example, there are artificial intelligence systems that can beat the world champion in the game of chess, which is the only thing they do.

 artificial general intelligence
 This type refers to computers with the level of human intelligence in all fields, that is, it can perform any intellectual task that a person can perform. Creating this type of intelligence is much more difficult than the previous type and we have not reached this level yet.

 Artificial superintelligence edit
 Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom defines superintelligence as “thought that is much smarter than the best human minds in nearly every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills,” and because of this type the field of artificial intelligence is an interesting area to delve into.
